<h1> HTML</h1>
<h2> Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) </h2>
<p> <abbr title=" Hypertext Markup Language"> HTML</abbr> is the standard <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language" target="_blank"> markup language[a]</a> for documents designed to be displayed in a   <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser" target="_blank"> web browser</a>. It defines the content and structure of <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_content" target="_blank"> web content</a>. It is often assisted by technologies such as <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" target="_blank"> Cascading Style Sheets </a> (CSS) and  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language" target="_blank"> scripting languages</a>.  such as  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank"> JavaScript</a>, a programming language.<br>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser" target="_blank"> web browsers</a>,receive HTML documents from a <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server" target="_blank"> web server</a>  or from local storage and  
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_engine"> render</a> the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page" target=> web pager</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web" target=> semantically</a>    and originally included cues for its appearance and originally included cues for its appearance.<br> 

<a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element" target=>  HTML elements</a>  are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language" target=> images</a>   and other objects such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element#Forms" target=> interactive</a>  forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_document" target=> structured documents</a>   by denoting structural  <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics" target=> semantics</a>  for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using  <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket#Angle_brackets" target=> angle brackets </a> . Tags such as &lt; img &gt; and &lt;input &gt; directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as &lt; p &gt; and &lt;/p &gt;  surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser" target=> Browsers </a>  do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.<br>

HTML can embed programs written in a <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language" target=> Scriptings language </a> such as <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target=> JavaScript </a> , which affects the behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium" target=> World Wide Web Consortium  </a> (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of  <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" target=> CSS  </a>  over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[3] A form of HTML, known as <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5 " target=> HTML5  </a>  , is used to display video and audio, primarily using the &lt; Canvas&gt;element, together with JavaScript.
